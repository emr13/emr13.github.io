    <h1>Memorable Fiction (from my younger days)</h1>

    <h2><em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</em> by Bill Martin and Eric Carle</h2><p>Of course I'm including the first book I remember reading on my own in my formative fiction, particularly for the vividness of my memory: I remember making sense of words for the first time, sitting alone on the steps to my basement as my mom did laundry below. Overjoyed, I went to my younger sister's room and read the book to her over and over again. Before I learned how to read, I loved looking at picture-books and making up my own narrative, but once I realized I could "decode" meaning by myself, I was hooked. My earliest passions in life were animals and drawing, so it makes sense that this book, with Eric Carle's colorful illustrations of animals, was the one that launched me on my journey.</p>

    <h2><em>Milkweed</em> by Jerry Spinelli</h2><p>This is the first book I can remember crying over, and then promptly re-reading. I'd experienced literary catharthis in other books before, but <em>Milkweed</em> showed me the ways that sadness resonates in descriptive imagery. I was struck by the end-scene, where the main character loses his friend Janina at a deportation platform, only to glimpse her for a moment, flying over the crowd like a puff of milkweed, into the arms of an S.S. officer. I knew the action of this scene was heartbreaking, but realized its poignancy had to do with Spinelli's language as well. In history books, these stories were told differently. I loved the empathetic appeal of fiction, where I could cry for characters, and feel their losses as my own. Another book that affected me in this way was <em>Walk Two Moons</em> by Sharon Creech. </p>

    <h2><em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em> by Lemony Snicket</h2><p> This was the first book series I felt drawn into, and the first time reading was a social event for me. My childhood best friend and I read the series together, and I committed my first bookclub cardinal offense when I spoiled the death of Count Olaf for her (in my defense, she could have kept up with my reading pace!). In retaliation, she emailed Lemony Snicket with all of our questions about the end of the series, and I was very upset. Here I realized that reading as a collective was more exciting than reading on your own, even if differing opinions lead to some drama.</p>

    <h2>The <em>Goosebumps</em> Series by R. L. Stine</h2><p>Another series I loved, but more for its predictable plot and formatting: curious pre-teen gets caught up in ghostly phenomenon. I also uncovered these in the basement of my childhood, locked in a trunk from the late 90s, which only added to their spooky appeal. Like sadness, I realized books could incite terror, which was great fun to read despite its predictability. Because I didn't read the <em>Harry Potter</em> books until I was older (I read those when I was fifteen just to say I had), I consider <em>Goosebumps</em> as my first foray into the world of fantasy (and horror). Unlike other authors I'd read, whose stories were driven by characterization, I noticed R.L. Stine's books were driven mostly by plot. I hadn't quite identified these as "pulp fiction" yet, but I do remember feeling dissatisfied by the emptiness of some character templates.</p>

    <h2><em>Different Seasons</em> by Stephen King</h2><p>Naturally, following from <em>Goosebumps</em>, is my abiding love for Stephen King.</p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/ThePrinceOfTides.jpg" alt="The Prince of Tides" height="400" width="150" class="center">
    <h2><em>The Prince of Tides</em> by Pat Conroy</h2>

    <h2><em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss</h2>
    <p>Notice that all of these authors are white, heterosexual males. You gain direction by looking at your earliest reading, because you know the weak points that you must address in your future reading.</p>
