    <h1>Formative Fictions</h1>
    <p>I hate when someone asks me: "What is your favorite book?", because I don't have a favorite book, and I can't force myself to lie about having one. I have favorite books, my preferred fictions, from different points in my life; maybe one or two "favorite books of all time," but even that is likely to change in five years time. I love when someone asks me, "What are you reading right now?", because I have less to retrieve from my memory, and more to say about something I'm currently reading. But favorites are trickier to place with confidence, and the reasoning behind them proves equally elusive. Nobody asks "What's your favorite book?" without anticipating an explanation of <em>why</em> that's your favorite book. The logic behind these questions stresses me out, so when asked, I defer or start summarizing a disorganized list. If I had the time and mental organization, I would like to go down a chronological list of all the books that built me, shaped me, and moved me to become whoever I am right now. My subconscious favorites, even if I wouldn't have called them 'favorites' at the time.</p>

    <p>So, that's what I started here: my track record with reading, specifically fiction. Remembering these books was remembering who I was when I first read them, a fun and frank visitation of my past. It's hard to describe the particular effect these books had on me, but the randomness is part of their endearing quality: life is random, and so is the fiction we come into contact with. The books I recounted are anything but precocious; still, I recall them with a certain fondness for a time when I was just beginning my journey with the written word. My choices here also reflect my background to some extent: neither of my parents are voracious readers (the only thing I remember my mom reading is <em>People Magazine</em>, and my dad kept a copy of <em>Into the Wild</em> on his nightstand, with a bookmark permanently on Chapter 14) so I traversed the literary landscape with absolute freedom at first. I think everyone can relate to the concept of a "formative fiction." I still don't have an answer to: "What's your favorite book?", but that's not an important question, anyway. If I could, I would ask you: what are the books that inform who you are today, and who you are still becoming?</p>
